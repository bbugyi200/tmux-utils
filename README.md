## Installation ðŸ—¹

### Using `pipx` to Install (preferred)

This package _could_ be installed using pip like any other Python package (in
fact, see the section below this one for instructions on how to do just that).
Given that we only need this package's entry points, however, we recommend that
[pipx][11] be used instead:

```shell
# install and setup pipx
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# install tmux_utils
pipx install tmux_utils
```

### Using `pip` to Install

To install `tmux_utils` using [pip][9], run the following
commands in your terminal:

``` shell
python3 -m pip install --user tmux_utils  # install tmux_utils
```

If you don't have pip installed, this [Python installation guide][10] can guide
you through the process.
